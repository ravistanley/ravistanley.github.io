### Scenario
Eric Fischer from the Purchasing Department at Bartell Ltd has received an email from a known contact with a Word document attachment.  Upon opening the document, he accidentally clicked on "Enable Content."  The SOC Department immediately received an alert from the endpoint agent that Eric's workstation was making suspicious connections outbound. The pcap was retrieved from the network sensor and handed to you for analysis.
#### Task: Investigate the packet capture and uncover the malicious activities.

### Traffic Analysis
We are required to load the pcap file into Wireshark and answer the following questions. 

#### What was the date and time for the first HTTP connection to the malicious IP?
(answer format: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss) <br>
First task is to get the date and time when the first HTTP connection to the malicious IP occurred. <br>
I filtered the HTTP traffic. Then since the format required is yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss , in the View tab in Wireshark change the Time Display Format. <br>
