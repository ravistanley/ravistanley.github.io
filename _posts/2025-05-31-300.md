### Challenge Overview
![Challenge](/assets/img/posts/300/300.png) <br>
"Now Shit is getting real a bit, but it's easy, don't over think, it's no maze and you are no runner"
We are given a 64-bit PIE ELF binary that prompts for a key and verifies it. From the description, we are told not to overthink it cause it is easy. <br>
Our goal is to find the correct input key to get the flag.

### Initial Recon
Using 'file' and 'checksec', we get: <br>
![Challenge](/assets/img/posts/300/recon.png) <br>
We see that the binary is a PIE executable with no canary, NX enabled, and partially RELRO.

Running the binary prompts for a key, and a random key yields 'Wrong key!: <br>

### Analysis
#### String Extraction
Running 'strings obfuscated' revealed some interesting strings: <br>
    - Rev3rs3MH
    - s3Maze!
    - acdfCTF{ObfuscatedSuccess} (likely the flag)
    - Wrong key!
    - Correct! Flag: %s

#### Tracing library cells (ltrace)
Running 'ltrace ./obfuscated' and entering some random input shows: <br>
![Challenge](/assets/img/posts/300/ltrace.png)
The program calls 'strlen("Rev3rs3Maze!")' internally. This is a strong hint that "Rev3rs3Maze!" is the key or closely related.

#### Key hypothesis
The program checks for the input key to match "Rev3rs3Maze!". <br>
This string is a combination of or close variant of the strings seen in 'strings' output.

### Solution
Let's enter the key: Rev3rs3Maze! <br>

Entering the key gives us the flag. <br>
Flag: acdfCTF{ObfuscatedSuccess}
